The specification is of the input language, and the central operations, 
of a domain-independent, partial order, constraint posting goal directed 
planner. It is essentially a model-based version of Chapman's TWEAK (1), 
and is used as a case study on VDM courses at the Univ. of Huddersfield. 
It is described fully, and prototyped in Prolog, in (2).
