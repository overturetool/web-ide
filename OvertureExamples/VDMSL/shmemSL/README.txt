This example was produced by Nick Battle and it is used in the VDMJ user
manual to illustrate different features of VDMJ. It models the behaviour
of the 32-bit shared memory quadrants of HP-UX, using a record type M to 
represent a block of memory which is either <FREE> or <USED>, and a 
sequence of M records to represent a Quadrant.

The specification output indicates which allocation policy, first-fit or 
best-fit (or neither), produces the most memory fragmentation.
