The tracker example is used in the mapping chapter of the VDM-SL
book by John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen to introduce 
mappings and mapping operators concerns a system for tracking the 
movement of containers of hazardous material between phases of 
processing in a nuclear reprocessing plant. It is inspired by 
the formal model of a plant controller architecture developed 
by Manchester Informatics Ltd. in collaboration with British 
Nuclear Fuels (Engineering) Ltd. (BNFL) in 1995. More can be
