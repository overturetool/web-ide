\section{A specification of the data structures}


\subsection{Constants}

The specification of the crosswords assistant starts with a series of constant
declarations:

\begin{itemize}
\item the size of the grid,
\item the set of allowed letters,
\item the character meant to represent a black square,
\item the character meant to represent an empty location.
\end{itemize}

\begin{vdm_al}
values size : nat = 8;
       letters : set of char =
		{'a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h',
		'i','j','k','l','m','n','o','p',
		'q','r','s','t','u','v','w','x','y','z'};
	black : char = '*';
	white : char = '_'
\end{vdm_al}

\subsection{Types}

The type $word$ is a sequence of characters that only includes
$letters$. It corresponds to the words that will appear on the grid.
Moreover, in a crossword grid a word is a sequence of at least two characters. 

\begin{vdm_al}
types  word = seq of char 
	inv w == elems(w) subset letters 
		and len w >= 2  ;
\end{vdm_al}

A second type is $pos$, i.e.\ strictly  positive natural numbers that are less
than or equal to the size of the grid. They will be used to refer to horizontal and
vertical positions on the grid. 
A third type, $position$, is a composite with two fields: the horizontal and
vertical offsets of a square in the grid.

\begin{vdm_al}
        pos = nat1 
        inv pos_v == pos_v <= size;
	position :: h : pos
		    v : pos;
\end{vdm_al}

The $grid$ is then introduced as a map from positions to characters. The
invariant ensures that:

\begin{itemize}
\item the grid only stores letters, empty locations  and black squares;
\item the domain of the map includes all locations of the grid. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{vdm_al}
	grid = map position to char
	inv gr == rng gr subset (letters union {white, black}) and 
	          dom gr = {mk_position(i,j) | i in set {1,...,size}, 
	                                       j in set {1,...,size}};
\end{vdm_al}

Finally, a quote type $HV$ is introduced to denote the horizontal and vertical
directions. 

\begin{vdm_al}
	HV = <H> | <V>
\end{vdm_al}


\newpage
\subsection{Global state}

The global state features three variables:

\begin{itemize}
\item the crossword grid 
\item two sets of words: the words to validate ($waiting-words$) and the ones
already validated ($valid-words$).
\end{itemize}

The invariant will be defined later as a function. The initial state specifies
that both sets of words are empty, and that all locations of the grid are
empty, i.e.\ store the $white$ character. 
\begin{vdm_al}
state  crosswords of
	 cwgrid : grid
	 valid_words : set of word
	 waiting_words : set of word
       inv mk_crosswords(gr,val,wait) == 
		CW_INVARIANT(gr,val,wait)
init mk_crosswords(gr,val,wait) ==
        val = { } and wait = { } and 
	forall i in set {1,...,size} &
	forall j in set {1,...,size} &
	gr(mk_position(i,j)) = white
end
\end{vdm_al}


\section{Functions}

\subsection{State invariant}

A first function is the state invariant. It takes three arguments corresponding
to the three variables of the global state and states that:

\begin{itemize}
\item the $valid-words$ and $waiting-words$ are disjoint, i.e.\ a word is
either valid or waiting;
\item every word of the grid appears in one of both sets;
\item the words of the waiting list all appear on the grid.
\end{itemize}

The invariant does not force the list of valid words to only store words of the
grid. It may also be filled in with input from an electronic dictionnary.
\begin{vdm_al}
functions
\end{vdm_al}

\begin{vdm_al}
CW_INVARIANT: grid * set of word * set of word +> bool
CW_INVARIANT(gr,val,wait) ==
val inter wait = {} 
and WORDS(gr) subset (val union wait)
and wait subset WORDS(gr)
;
\end{vdm_al}

\subsection{Words of a grid}

In this definition of the invariant, the $WORDS$ function was introduced. It is
a function which returns the set of all words that appear on the grid, given as
argument. It has been chosen to specify this as an explicit boolean function
which returns the union of the words that appear horizontally in the grid, and
the words that appear vertically.
\begin{vdm_al}
WORDS : grid +> set of word
WORDS(g) == HOR_WORDS(g) union VER_WORDS(g)
;
\end{vdm_al}

$HOR-WORDS$ and $VER-WORDS$ are also explicit functions. They are expressed as
the distributed union of the words that appear on every line or every column of
the grid respectively.
\begin{vdm_al}
HOR_WORDS : grid +> set of word
HOR_WORDS(g) == dunion { WORDS_OF_SEQ(LINE(i,g)) | i in set {1,...,size}}
;
VER_WORDS : grid +> set of word
VER_WORDS(g) == dunion { WORDS_OF_SEQ(COL(i,g)) | i in set {1,...,size}}
;
\end{vdm_al}

$LINE$ and $COL$ are functions that extract from a grid the ith line or column
respectively and return it as a sequence of characters.

\begin{vdm_al}
LINE : pos *  grid +> seq of char
LINE(i,g) == [g(mk_position(i,c)) | c in set {1,...,size}]
;
COL : pos *  grid +> seq of char
COL(i,g) == [g(mk_position(l,i)) | l in set {1,...,size}]
;
\end{vdm_al}

$WORDS-OF-SEQ$ returns the set of words that appear in a sequence of
characters. A word is defined as a sequence of letters such that its neighbour
characters (if any) are $white$ or $black$. The code of the explicit function
is rather implicit since it refers to a set comprehension definition which is
not executable.
\begin{vdm_al}
WORDS_OF_SEQ : seq of char +> set of word
WORDS_OF_SEQ(s) == {w | w : word & 
		exists s1, s2 : seq of char &
			s = s1 ^ w ^ s2
		        and (s1 = [] or s1(len s1) = black or s1(len s1) = white)
			and (s2 = [] or s2(1) = black or s2(1) = white)}
;
\end{vdm_al}

\newpage
\subsection{Compatibility with the grid}

When a new word will be added to the grid, it is necessary to check that :
\begin{itemize}
\item the length of the word fits in the grid;
\item this word will not destroy existing information, i.e.\ the grid locations
that will be overwritten by the word are either $white$ or already store the
corresponding letter of the word.
\end{itemize}

\begin{vdm_al}
COMPATIBLE : grid * word * position * HV +> bool
COMPATIBLE (g, w, p, d ) == 
	    (d = <H> => 
		(p.h + len w -1 <= size)
		and forall i in set inds w &
		    	g(mk_position(p.h + i -1, p.v)) = white
			or g(mk_position(p.h + i -1, p.v)) = w(i)
			)
	    and
	    (d = <V> => 
		(p.v + len w -1 <= size)
		and forall i in set inds w &
			g(mk_position(p.h, p.v + i -1)) = white
			or g(mk_position(p.h, p.v + i -1)) = w(i))
;
\end{vdm_al}   

When a word is deleted from the grid, it is necessary to check that a given
word appears at a given location in a given direction. This boolean function is
expressed hereafter.

\begin{vdm_al}
IS_LOCATED : grid * word * position * HV +> bool
IS_LOCATED (g, w, p, d ) == 
	    (d = <H> => 
		 forall i in set inds w &
		    g(mk_position(p.h + i -1, p.v)) = w(i))
	    and
	    (d = <V> => 
		 forall i in set inds w &
			g(mk_position(p.h, p.v + i -1)) = w(i))
;
\end{vdm_al}

\subsection{Detection of words}

In the deletion operation, it will be necessary to decide wheter a letter in a
given position on
the grid  is part of a word in a given direction. To be part of a word means
that there exists a sequence of positions on the grid that features  a word and
includes the given position. 


\begin{vdm_al}
IN_WORD: grid * position * HV +> bool
IN_WORD(g,p,d) ==
(d = <H> => 
	exists i,j : pos &
		i <= p.h and j >= p.h and i < j and
		forall k in set {i,..., j} &
			g(mk_position(k,p.v)) in set letters)
and
(d = <V> => 
	exists i,j : pos &
		i <= p.v and j >= p.v and i < j and
		forall k in set {i,..., j} &
			g(mk_position(p.h,k)) in set letters)

\end{vdm_al}   

\section{Operations}


The operations are of three kinds:

\begin{itemize}
\item validation of a word of the waiting list;
\item adding information to the grid;
\item deleting information from the grid.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Validation of words}

This section only features a single operation $VALIDATE-WORD$ which transfers a
word of the waiting list into the valid list. The pre-condition states that the
word must be in the waiting list, while the post-condition expresses that the
two sets have been modified by deleting the word from the one and adding it to
the second. The state invariant is preserved by this operation since

\begin{itemize}
\item the two sets remain disjoint
\item No new word has been added to  $waiting-words$ and the grid has not been
affected. The elements of $waiting-words$ remain thus
members of the grid.
\end{itemize}

\begin{vdm_al}
operations
\end{vdm_al}   
\begin{vdm_al}
VALIDATE_WORD (w : word)
ext wr valid_words : set of word
    wr waiting_words : set of word
   pre w in set waiting_words
  post valid_words = valid_words~ union {w}
       and waiting_words = waiting_words~ \ {w}
;
\end{vdm_al}   

\subsection{Adding information to the grid}

There are actually two ways to modify the grid: either by adding new words
($ADD-WORD$) or by adding black squares ($ADD-BLACK$). 

To add a word to the grid, three inputs are needed: the actual word to add, the
position where it must be added and the horizontal/vertical direction of this
addition. The pre-condition must ensure that the word is compatible with the
existing grid, i.e.\ that it will only modify $white$ locations. The
compatibility also ensures that the length of the word fits in the grid.  The
post-condition expresses the modification of the grid in terms of an
overwriting map, given in comprehension. It also includes  the state invariant
in order to guarantee it. Obviously, this operation preserves the state
invariant, but it is necessary to check that it is implementable, i.e.\ that
there exists a final state corresponding to this post-condition. 

This proof may be informally stated as follows. Since $d$ is either $H$ or $V$,
the new grid will be the previous one overwritten by a map. Since this map only
adds letters to the grid and the length of the word has been checked to fit in
the grid, the grid will keep its type. It must then be checked that it is
possible to extract a list of waiting words from this grid, given an untouched
list of valid words. This is achieved by extracting the set of words of the
grid and substracting the valid words from this set.


\begin{vdm_al}
ADD_WORD (w : word, p : position, d : HV)
ext wr cwgrid : grid
    rd valid_words : set of word
    wr waiting_words : set of word
   pre COMPATIBLE(cwgrid, w, p, d)
  post (d = <H> =>
	cwgrid = cwgrid~ ++ {mk_position(p.h + i - 1, p.v) |-> w(i) 
	                    | i in set inds w})
	and
 	(d = <V> =>
	cwgrid = cwgrid~ ++ {mk_position(p.h, p.v + i - 1) |-> w(i) 
	                    | i in set inds w})
	and
	CW_INVARIANT(cwgrid, valid_words,waiting_words)
;
\end{vdm_al}   


The $ADD-BLACK$ operations replaces an empty location by  a black square. 
The precondition checks that the position given as input stores an empty
location, and the post-condition overwrites the grid with a single maplet.
This operation preserves the state invariant since it does not destroy letters
from the grid and thus preserves the existing words.

\begin{vdm_al}
ADD_BLACK ( p : position)
ext wr cwgrid : grid
   pre cwgrid(p) = white
  post cwgrid = cwgrid~ ++ { p |-> black }
;
\end{vdm_al}   

\subsection{Deleting information from  the grid}

Three operations are proposed to delete information from the grid. The simplest
operation is the deletion of a black square. The remaining operations are
concerned with deleting an existing word. Two operations are proposed. A ``strong''
delete wipes out every letter of the word. Its application to word {\tt
cord} in the example would result in : 

\vspace{0.5cm}

{\tt \begin{tabular}{r|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8\\
\hline
\multicolumn{9}{l}{\ldots}\\
\hline
3 & & & &w& & & & \\
\hline
4 & & &c &o &a &l & & \\
\hline
5 & & &a &r&t & & & \\
\hline
6 & & & && & & & \\
\hline
\multicolumn{9}{l}{\ldots}\\
\end{tabular}} 

\vspace{0.5cm}

This is probably too destructive because the words {\tt car} and {\tt word} have
been modified as a consequence of this operation. So a ``soft'' delete is
proposed which checks if a letter is member of a word in the orthogonal
direction. In our example, it would result in :

\vspace{0.5cm}

{\tt \begin{tabular}{r|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8\\
\hline
\multicolumn{9}{l}{\ldots}\\
\hline
3 & & & &w& & & & \\
\hline
4 & & &c &o &a &l & & \\
\hline
5 & & &a &r&t & & & \\
\hline
6 & & &r &d& & & & \\
\hline
\multicolumn{9}{l}{\ldots}\\
\end{tabular}}
\vspace{0.5cm}

where {\tt rd} will appear as a new word in the $waiting-words$.


The first operation is $DELETE-BLACK$ which is the dual of $ADD-BLACK$. It
similarly preserves the state invariant.

\begin{vdm_al}
DELETE_BLACK ( p : position)
ext wr cwgrid : grid
   pre cwgrid(p) = black
  post cwgrid = cwgrid~ ++ { p |-> white }
;
\end{vdm_al}   


The $STRONG-DELETE$ receives three inputs: the word to delete, its position,
and its direction. The operation may not affect the list of valid words but may
modify the grid and the waiting list. The precondition checks that the word is
effectively located in the grid at the given position. The post-condition
overwrites the grid with a map of empty locations and states that the invariant
is preserved. The informal proof of the implementability of this operation is
similar to the $ADD-WORD$ one.

\begin{vdm_al}
STRONG_DELETE (w : word, p : position, d : HV)
ext wr cwgrid : grid
    rd valid_words : set of word
    wr waiting_words : set of word
   pre IS_LOCATED(cwgrid, w, p, d)
  post (d = <H> =>
	cwgrid = cwgrid~ ++ {mk_position(p.h + i - 1, p.v) |-> white 
	                    | i in set inds w})
	and
 	(d = <V> =>
	cwgrid = cwgrid~ ++ {mk_position(p.h, p.v + i - 1) |-> white 
	                    | i in set inds w})
	and
	CW_INVARIANT(cwgrid,valid_words, waiting_words)
;
\end{vdm_al}   


The $SOFT-DELETE$ is very similar to $STRONG-DELETE$. The major difference is
that the overwriting map is filtered by the $IN-WORD$ function: a letter is
overwritten  only if it does not appear in a word in the orthogonal direction.
\begin{vdm_al}
SOFT_DELETE (w : word, p : position, d : HV)
ext wr cwgrid : grid
    rd valid_words : set of word
    wr waiting_words : set of word
   pre IS_LOCATED(cwgrid, w, p, d)
  post (d = <H> =>
	cwgrid = cwgrid~ ++ 
		{mk_position(p.h + i - 1, p.v) |-> white 
			| i in set inds w 
			& not IN_WORD(cwgrid~,mk_position(p.h + i - 1, p.v),<V>) })
	and
	(d = <V> =>
	cwgrid = cwgrid~ ++ 
		{mk_position(p.h, p.v + i - 1) |-> white 
			| i in set inds w 
			& not IN_WORD(cwgrid~,mk_position(p.h, p.v + i - 1),<H>) })
	and
	CW_INVARIANT(cwgrid,valid_words, waiting_words)
\end{vdm_al}


An alternate version of $SOFT-DELETE$ could be designed that would only leave
on the grid the letters of validated words. This could be easily performed by
checking that the word that the location belongs to is in the valid list.
